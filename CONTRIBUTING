How to contribute


Installation:

You will first need to clone or fork the project from GitHUB:

git clone https://github.com/s-ball/i18nparse.git


Improving existing translations:

The po files are is the src directory, named as xx.po, where xx is a
language code. They are text files, so you can easily edit them.


Adding new languages:

The src directory contains the argparse.pot file which is a standard portable
object template. There are plenty of tools allowing to produce and generate a
new po file (GNU gettext, poedit, etc.) and their description is beyond the
object of this text.


Testing locally:

The project uses hatch as its build system. You can simply build a new source
distribution and the associated wheel with `hatch build` from a GitHub clone
or a source distribution from PyPI.

The recommended way is to do that in a virtual environment.

Upload:

The expected way is to submit a pull request on GitHUB. If you are not
comfortable with that, you can post an issue with the new po file as an
attachment. As I maintain the project on my free time, I cannot guarantee
to always be highly responsive. But as I am very interested in the project
since I created it, be assured that I will do my best to incorporate
additions and improvements.


Caveats:

pot and po files are assumed to use UTF-8. Beware when using Windows...

The "compiled" mo files (for machine object) and generated by setup.py during
 the build phase. That means that they will never exist in the source tree.
Be sure to never import from the source tree for that reason...
